Feedback:
1- Didn't follow naming conventions (for class name).
2- a zero-constructor was defined which is useless.
3- 'setName' and 'setPrice' methods didn't have a condition to ensure that the input value is valid.
4- 'setName' and 'setPrice' weren't used in constructor to ensure that the input value is valid.
5- needs to define more methods.
